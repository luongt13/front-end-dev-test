## Technologies
- React: make reusable components 
- Material UI: why recreate something when it's already done

## Questions:
- What technologies you used and why? 

See technologies section

- Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

Some struggles with making the images respond the way I want them to. The small details of having space between each section. It would be fun to build a full-stack with actual data.

- What you enjoyed the most and why

It was fun using the technologies to build the application. It's exciting to bring the design to life!
